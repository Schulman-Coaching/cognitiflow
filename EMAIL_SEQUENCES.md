### Email 2: Value Add (Sent: Day 2)

**Subject:** {first_name}, here's what most businesses automate first

```
Hi {first_name},

Quick follow-up from yesterday. I wanted to share what we've learned from helping dozens of businesses with automation.

The top 3 tasks our clients automate first:

📧 **Email triage** (saves 10+ hours/week)
- Sorting, categorizing, and responding to routine messages
- Routing urgent items to the right person
- Never missing an important email again

📄 **Invoice processing** (saves 15+ hours/week)
- Extracting data from invoices automatically
- Matching with purchase orders
- Updating accounting systems

📊 **Data entry** (saves 25+ hours/week)
- Moving information between systems
- Keeping spreadsheets updated
- Eliminating copy-paste errors

Based on what you mentioned wanting to automate, I think we could help you save {estimated_hours} hours per week.

Elie

### Email 3: Social Proof (Sent: Day 4)

**Subject:** How {industry} companies are using AI automation

```
Hi {first_name},

I noticed you're in {industry}. Here's a quick case study that might be relevant:

---

**Challenge:** A {similar_company_type} was spending 20+ hours per week on manual data entry and invoice processing.

**Solution:** We set up automated workflows that:
- Extract data from incoming emails and documents
- Update their CRM and accounting systems
- Send confirmation emails to vendors

**Results:**
✅ 85% reduction in manual data entry
✅ $4,200/month saved (vs. hiring a part-time admin)
✅ Zero data entry errors since implementation

---

The best part? Setup took less than 2 hours, and they started seeing results the same day.

I'd love to show you how we could achieve similar results for {company}.

### Email 2: Implementation Tips (Sent: Day 3)

**Subject:** Did you try the cost calculator yet?

```
Hi {first_name},

Quick check-in - did you have a chance to look through the Automation Survival Kit?

Most people find the Cost Calculator (page 12) surprisingly eye-opening.

Here's a quick example:

If you spend just 2 hours per day on repetitive tasks:
- That's 10 hours per week
- Or 520 hours per year
- At $50/hour value = **$26,000/year** in lost productivity

And that's just ONE person. Multiply that across your team...

The good news? Most of those tasks can be automated for a fraction of that cost.

Want to run through your specific numbers together? [Book a free 15-minute call](https://calendly.com/elie-schulman/ai-strategy-consultation) and I'll help you calculate your potential savings.

Best,
Elie

P.S. No sales pitch - just math. You'll walk away knowing exactly what automation could save you.
